# 📬 Gmail Smart Auto-Responder & Classifier (n8n + LLM)

This project is a **Gmail automation workflow built in n8n** that:
- Automatically **detects new Gmail messages** every minute.
- Extracts the **sender's name** using LLM-powered information extraction.
- Uses AI to **classify the email** into one of four categories.
- Adds appropriate **labels** in Gmail based on classification.
- Sends an **auto-reply email** with a personalized greeting.

## ⚙️ What It Does

### 1. Trigger on New Emails
- Gmail Trigger polls every minute.
- Ignores spam/trash by default.

### 2. Extract Sender’s Name
- Uses LangChain’s Information Extractor.
- If sender's name is found → personalizes the email.
- If not → uses a fallback greeting ("Hey").

### 3. Personalized Response Crafting
- Constructs a greeting like `Dear John` or `Hey`.

### 4. Classify Email Content
- Classifies incoming emails into one of 4 categories using LLM:
  - `n8n Messages`
  - `LangGraph Messages`
  - `Personal Messages`
  - `Any Messages`

### 5. Label the Email Accordingly
- Each category maps to a specific Gmail label (custom IDs).

### 6. Send Auto-Response
- Sends a contextual reply based on the classification.
- Replies differ based on whether the email is personal, about n8n, LangGraph, or generic.
